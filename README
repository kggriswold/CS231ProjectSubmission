You are going to need numpy, tensorflow, and matplotlib to run this code on your machine, along with python version 2.7.6.

Note that I didn't develop in this repository (I didn't have a group, so I just used a folder on my laptop), but I think I copied everything over properly in the same format - I'm not able to test it though without including the data, and making two copies of it would take up too much space on my machine (I am running low on hard drive space).  If you extract the competition zip files into the StateFarmDriverDetection directory it should work fine though.  Email me if you have any trouble getting it to run properly.
